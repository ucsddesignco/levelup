Ultimately, they hope their solution inspires tech companies to utilize their platforms to encourage users to participate and share their voice in the voting process.",

To address this, we decided to create an app that allows users to engage in meaningful, facilitated, and anonymous conversations about a variety of political topics. Through our design work, we hope to create an experience that engages the voting youth and normalizes civilized political discourse.",
